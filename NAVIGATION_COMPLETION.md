## Task 1.7: Implement responsive navigation system âœ… COMPLETED

### What was implemented:

#### 1. **Enhanced Navigation Component** (`src/components/layout/Navigation.tsx`)
- **Dynamic Active Section Detection**: Automatically detects which section is currently in view
- **Improved Accessibility**: Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with proper ARIA labels, roles, and keyboard navigation
- **Enhanced Visual Design**: Added icons, hover effects, and smooth animations
- **Better Mobile Experience**: Larger touch targets and improved mobile navigation
- **External Link Handling**: Proper handling of external links with visual indicators
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support with Enter/Space key handling

#### 2. **Advanced Mobile Menu** (`src/components/layout/MobileMenu.tsx`)
- **Focus Management**: Proper focus trapping and restoration
- **Enhanced Animations**: Smooth slide-in animations with staggered item reveals
- **Better UX**: Added call-to-action section and improved content layout
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Overlay Interaction**: Click outside to close functionality

#### 3. **Smart Navigation Hook** (`src/hooks/useNavigation.ts`)
- **Automatic Section Detection**: Intelligently detects active sections based on scroll position
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Enhanced smooth scroll with proper offset calculation
- **Performance Optimized**: Uses passive event listeners and requestAnimationFrame
- **Configurable**: Customizable sections and offset values
- **State Management**: Centralized navigation state management

#### 4. **Enhanced Header Component** (`src/components/layout/Header.tsx`)
- **Improved State Management**: Uses the new navigation hook for better performance
- **Better Theme Integration**: Enhanced theme toggle functionality
- **Responsive Design**: Improved mobile menu toggle with better accessibility
- **Scroll Detection**: Visual feedback based on scroll position

#### 5. **Advanced CSS Animations** (`src/app/globals.css`)
