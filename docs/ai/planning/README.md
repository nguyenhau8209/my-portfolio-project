## Risks & Mitigation
**What could go wrong?**

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Form submission failures with Formspree
- **Mitigation**: Test thoroughly, implement backup solution (Google Forms), add error handling

- **Risk**: Performance issues affecting Core Web Vitals
- **Mitigation**: Optimize images, implement lazy loading, monitor Lighthouse scores regularly

- **Risk**: Mobile responsiveness issues
- **Mitigation**: Mobile-first design approach, extensive mobile testing, use responsive design tools

- **Risk**: Cross-browser compatibility problems
